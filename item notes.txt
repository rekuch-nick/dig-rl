potions to add:


sense monster (as max level but temp buff)
(?) remove curse (return all held items to +0 or better)
web (put web traps all over, web debuff mobs inside)



ring of sense monster scales:
see minor ghosts
see closeby unseen mobs
see major ghosts
see mob intent (do they see player?)
see all unseen mobs
(gonna be hard to make it improve each level, every other might be enough)
