slow effect amks you miss seems wrong
	plus should end if you run/wait long enough
freezelock still too strong (maybe not since we x2ed hp?)



make mouse cursor move with arrorws when throwing / bag screen


teleport monster image
flytryp poisions verb order
make ground trearue more interesting..




-tips to add:
	throw a potion into a cauldren to double it

-level features
hall of mirrors maze
patches
square rooms
forest with line of sight vision
trap run
river
longgrass
spreading lava
(some rolled, some scripted which level they will appear at)

-area biomes
(just set tiles and mob sets, maaayyybe limited other worldgen)
((maybe treasure level decided by this? could make the gameflow better by encouraging less exporation at diff times))
